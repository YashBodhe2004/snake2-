//SELF INTRODUCTION

Hey guys my name is yash Bodhe .
I have created a game which gives you the retro vibe of one of the oldest game “ SNAKES”  , which everyone of us have played, with an added Flavour of modern feel and customization , keeping the essence of the old game.
 
The Front page involves the play button and the instructions option , which includes media queries through which it becomes interactive for the user even if they use on any device.

Note:- Play the game in full screen mode.


This Is  how it looks in certain dimensions. ON LAPTOP SCREEN:

Each and every option on hovering changes it’s color to red.
Incase the user wants the instructions to play the game , as soon as the user clicks, they get redirected to the page of instructions  , wherein the user can see the proceed button to go to the next page.
Or else the user can directly click on play button and go to next page.
This is how the instructions page looks on reduced dimensions.

On laptop screen:

After clicking the PROCEED button the user gets to a new page , where the user gets to enter his/her name and also choose their Nickname.
This is how the Form page looks on Mobile an laptop device respectively.

All the buttons and the title on clicking change their dimensions and color. After clicking on the play button , the user finally enters the game .
In which the user on eating berries, scores points and the length of snakes increases. The user can enjoy the game.
When the user uses the laptop , they can operate the snake using the keyboard  arrow keys to move up – down, right-left. Also on the mobile  the controls are provided on screen for convenience. In this way the user can take the entire feel of the game.![Screenshot 2023-11-25 134632](https://github.com/YashBodhe2004/snake2-/assets/144336541/cf5c2dcd-d4f3-452a-904a-24ca019f4709)

After this the user gets to the last page of the game , wherein the user gets to see his score and also gets to decide if he has to replay the game or exit, if the user clicks on replay then they get directed to the game page.
